### Hi there, this is Inkyu ðŸ‘‹

My interests are in the fields of field robotics, applied machine learning, and virtual reality. I am particularly interested in the intersection of these technologies and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. For example, I am interested in using field robotics to explore dangerous or inaccessible environments, such as the deep sea or the surface of Mars. I am also interested in using applied machine learning to improve the performance of virtual reality systems, such as by making them more immersive and realistic.

I am always looking for new and interesting ways to apply these technologies. If you have any questions or ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to discuss them with you.

### My Kaggle profile
---
Kaggle is one of my favorite places to learn and explore new machine learning (ML) technologies. I have found it to be a fun and entertaining playground where I can apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems.

If you are also interested in ML or other state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies, I highly recommend checking out Kaggle. There are a wide range of challenging problems that need to be solved, and Kaggle provides a great platform for learning and collaboration.

Here is my Kaggle profile page: [My Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/enddl22)

I hope you enjoy Kaggle as much as I do!
